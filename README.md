# Solar-Tracker
A solar tracker is a device that orients solar panels - mirrors toward the sun to maximize energy capture. It adjusts the position of the panels throughout the day to follow the sun’s path, improving efficiency compared to fixed systems. The captured solar energy is converted into another form of energy — electrical energy — which can then be used to charge mobile phones or various other devices.
